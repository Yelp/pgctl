Introduction
------------

``pgctl`` is an `MIT Licensed
<https://github.com/Yelp/pgctl/blob/master/COPYING>`_ tool to manage developer "playgrounds".

Often projects have various processes that should run in the backround
(*services*) during development. These services amount to a miniature staging
environment that we term *playground*. Each service must have a well-defined
state at all times (it should be starting, up or down), and should be
independantly restartable and debuggable.

``pgctl`` aims to solve this problem in a unified, language-agnostic
framework (although the tool happens to be written in Python).


As a simple example, let's say that we want a `date` service in our playground,
that ensures our `now.date` file always has the current date. 

::

   $ cat playground/date/run
   date > now.date

   $ pgctl-2015 start
   $ pgctl-2015 status
   date -- up (0 seconds)

   $ cat now.date
   Fri Jun 26 15:21:26 PDT 2015

   $ pgctl-2015 stop
   $ pgctl-2015 status
   date -- down (0 seconds)
